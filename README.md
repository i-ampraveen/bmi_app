# BMI App

This is my first flutter application (android).
BMI App.

## Getting Started

App Description: Body mass index is a familiar term for those who are weight conscious. It is the term that let user know about the overall body composition in terms of fat.
In this app, user can select their Gender, Age, Height and Weight and calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI).</br>

### User Actions:
> Need to select a gender. </br>
> Need to select his/her age. </br>
> Need to select his/her height. </br>
> Need to select his/her weight. </br>


OnPress of calculate button </br>

### System Actions:
BMI value is displayed along with the category (Underweight / Normal / Overweight).

## Packages used in this App:
`flutter_screenutil` for reasonable layout on different screen sizes (Adaptive screen size and fonts). </br>
`flutter_icons` for custom icons (We can make it work without this) </br>
`flutter_launcher_icons` to generate flutter launcher icons.

## How this App looks like in an Android phone :heart_eyes:
